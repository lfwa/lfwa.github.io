I am a MSc student in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/) currently working on data marketplaces and
data valuation with [David Dao](https://daviddao.org/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/).
In my research I explore how we can value data and create data marketplaces when data contributors may exhibit
adversarial behavior.

Previously, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/) and
researched sustainability and resource efficiency of machine learning, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Raghav
Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/). I have also worked as a software developer at
[Nykredit](https://www.nykredit.com/en-gb/).
