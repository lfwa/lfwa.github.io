I graduated with a MSc in Computer Science from [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), where I worked on data valuation and performative prediction with [David Dao](https://daviddao.org/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/).
In my research I explored how we can value data and create robust strategies when data contributors may exhibit adversarial behavior.

Previously, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/) and
researched sustainability and resource efficiency of machine learning, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Raghav
Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/). I have also worked as a software developer at
[Nykredit](https://www.nykredit.com/en-gb/).
