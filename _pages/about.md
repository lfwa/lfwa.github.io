Currently, I work as a Quant at [UBS](https://www.ubs.com/ch/en.html) in Zurich.
After a successful tenure as a Quant Developer in Treasury Risk Control, where I engineered big data solutions for balance sheet analytics, I transitioned internally to the QuantHub team.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science from [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), where I worked on data valuation and performative prediction under the guidance of [Dr. David Dao](https://daviddao.org/) and [Prof. Dr. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/).
In my research, I explored how we can value data and create robust strategies when data contributors may exhibit adversarial behavior.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/) and
researched sustainability and resource efficiency of machine learning, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Raghav Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/).
Additionally, I have worked as a software developer at [Nykredit](https://www.nykredit.com/en-gb/) and had a short stint as an AI / Machine Learning Specialist at the [Alexandra Institute](https://alexandra.dk/about-the-alexandra-institute/).
