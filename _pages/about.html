<h1>About Me</h1>
I am a MSc student in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/) currently working on data marketplaces and
data valuation with [David Dao](https://daviddao.org/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/).
In my research I explore how we can value data and create data marketplaces when data contributors may exhibit
adversarial behavior.

Previously, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/) and
researched sustainability and resource efficiency of machine learning, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Raghav
Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/). I have also worked as a software developer at
[Nykredit](https://www.nykredit.com/en-gb/).

                    <p>Geological evidence of active tropical glaciers reaching sea level during the Neoproterozoic
                        (1,000–541 Ma), suggesting a global ocean completely covered in ice, was the key observation in
                        the development of the hard Snowball Earth hypothesis. These conditions are hard to reconcile
                        with the survival of complex marine life through Snowball Earth glaciations, which led to
                        alternative waterbelt scenarios where a large-scale refugium was present in the form of a narrow
                        ice-free strip in the tropical ocean. Here we assess whether a waterbelt scenario maintained by
                        snow-free dark sea ice at low latitudes is plausible using simulations from two climate models
                        run with a variety of cloud treatments in combination with an energy-balance model. Our
                        simulations show that waterbelt states are not a robust and naturally emerging feature of
                        Neoproterozoic climate. Intense shortwave reflection by mixed-phase clouds, in addition to a low
                        albedo of bare sea ice, is needed for geologically relevant waterbelt states. Given the large
                        uncertainty in mixed-phase clouds and their interaction with radiation, our results strongly
                        question the idea that waterbelt scenarios can explain the Neoproterozoic geology. Hence,
                        Neoproterozoic life has probably faced the harsh conditions of a hard Snowball Earth.</p>

                    <p>Snowball Earth is a hypothesized state in the deep past of Earth in which the ocean was
                        completely or nearly completely covered by sea ice, resulting from a runaway ice-albedo
                        feedback. Here, we address how the treatment of sea-ice thermodynamics affects the initiation of
                        a Snowball Earth in the global climate model ICON-A run in an idealized slab-ocean aquaplanet
                        setup. Specifically, we study the impact of vertical resolution and brine pockets of ice by
                        comparing the 3-layer Winton and a 0-layer Semtner scheme, and we investigate the impact of
                        limiting ice thickness to 5 m. The internal heat storage of ice is increased by higher vertical
                        resolution and brine pockets, which weakens surface melting and increases global albedo by
                        allowing snow and ice to persist longer into the summer season. The internal heat storage
                        weakens the melt-ratchet effect, as is confirmed with offline simulations with the two ice
                        schemes. The result is a substantially easier Snowball Earth initiation and an increase in the
                        critical CO2 for Snowball initiation by 50%. Limiting ice thickness impedes Snowball initiation
                        as the removal of excess ice leads to an artificial heat source. Yet, the impact is minor and
                        critical CO2 is decreased by 5% only. The results show that while the sea-ice thickness limit
                        plays only a minor role, the internal heat storage of ice represents an important factor for
                        Snowball initiation and needs to be taken into account when modeling Snowball Earth initiation.
