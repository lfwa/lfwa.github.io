Highlighted projects
======
**Carbontracker**\
[github.com/lfwa/carbontracker](https://github.com/lfwa/carbontracker)\
Open-source tool for tracking and predicting the energy consumption and carbon emissions of training deep learning models in Python. The tool is freely distributed under the MIT License. Corresponding publication [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03051). It has been downloaded $>$$60$k times on the Python Package Index (PyPI) as of writing.

**Datadynamics**\
[github.com/lfwa/datadynamics](https://github.com/lfwa/datadynamics)\
Open-source library and environment for simulating data collection dynamics in multi-agent settings, primarily targeting the exploration of data valuation approaches. The library is freely distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License.

**Reinforced Graph Neural Networks for Collaborative Filtering**\
[github.com/lfwa/reinforced-gnn](https://github.com/lfwa/reinforced-gnn)\
Introduced a novel architecture to generate predictive compatibility scores for never-before-seen content in recommendation systems. The architecture combines the strength of graph-extracted embeddings in a graph neural network with the generalization power of a deep feed-forward network and adds "reinforcements" providing additional information to the network.

**Static Taint Analysis For Ethereum Contracts**\
[github.com/lfwa/vulnerable-ethereum-contracts](https://github.com/lfwa/vulnerable-ethereum-contracts)\
Designed and implemented a static taint analyzer in Datalog for Ethereum smart contracts. The analyzer detects vulnerable contracts that may be deleted from the blockchain and have all remaining cryptocurrency transferred to an untrusted address.

**Supporting Alternative SMT Solvers in Viper**\
[github.com/viperproject](https://github.com/viperproject)\
Added support for multiple SMT solvers, such as cvc5, in the symbolic-execution based automated verification backend written in Scala for the program verification tool chain and infrastructure, Viper.
